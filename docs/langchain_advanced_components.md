# Advanced LangChain 0.3 Components for Document Extraction

This document explores advanced LangChain 0.3 components that can enhance our document extraction system, focusing on LLMs, memory, vectorstores, embeddings, semantic search, re-ranking, and advanced reasoning patterns.

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

LangChain 0.3 provides a unified interface for working with various LLMs:

## Memory Systems

LangChain 0.3 offers sophisticated memory systems for maintaining context:

### Key Memory Components

## Vector Stores and Embeddings

LangChain 0.3 provides robust support for vector stores and embeddings:

### Key Vector Store Components

- **FAISS**: Facebook AI Similarity Search for efficient vector storage
- **Chroma**: Open-source embedding database
- **Pinecone**: Managed vector database service
- **Weaviate**: Vector search engine with GraphQL API
- **InMemoryVectorStore**: Simple in-memory vector store for testing

### Key Embedding Components

- **OpenAIEmbeddings**: OpenAI's text embedding models
- **HuggingFaceEmbeddings**: Hugging Face's embedding models
- **CohereEmbeddings**: Cohere's embedding models
- **SentenceTransformerEmbeddings**: Local embedding models

### Implementation Opportunities

- **Document Chunking with Embeddings**: Use embeddings to create semantically meaningful chunks
- **Semantic Deduplication**: Improve deduplication using embedding similarity
- **Cross-Document Relationships**: Identify relationships between documents
- **Contextual Retrieval**: Retrieve relevant context for extraction tasks

## Semantic Search and Re-Ranking

LangChain 0.3 provides advanced search and re-ranking capabilities:

### Key Search Components

- **VectorStoreRetriever**: Retrieves documents based on vector similarity
- **SelfQueryRetriever**: Translates natural language to structured queries
- **MultiQueryRetriever**: Generates multiple queries for better recall
- **ContextualCompressionRetriever**: Filters and compresses retrieved documents

### Key Re-Ranking Components

- **LLMReranker**: Uses LLM to re-rank retrieved documents
- **CohereRerank**: Uses Cohere's re-ranking API
- **EmbeddingsFilter**: Filters documents based on embedding similarity

### Implementation Opportunities

- **Semantic Document Filtering**: Filter documents based on semantic relevance
- **Query Expansion**: Generate multiple queries to improve extraction coverage
- **Contextual Compression**: Extract only relevant parts of documents
- **Hybrid Search**: Combine keyword and semantic search for better results

## Advanced Reasoning Patterns

LangChain 0.3 supports sophisticated reasoning patterns:

### ReAct Pattern (Reasoning + Acting)

The ReAct pattern combines reasoning and acting in an iterative process:

1. **Reasoning**: The LLM reasons about the current state and decides what to do
2. **Acting**: The LLM takes an action based on its reasoning
3. **Observation**: The system observes the result of the action
4. **Repeat**: The cycle continues until the task is complete

### Implementation Opportunities

- **Iterative Extraction**: Extract information in multiple passes, refining results
- **Self-Verification**: Verify extraction results and correct errors
- **Adaptive Extraction**: Adapt extraction strategies based on document content
- **Multi-Document Reasoning**: Reason across multiple documents to extract coherent information

### Thinking LLMs

LangChain 0.3 supports "thinking" patterns where LLMs can reason step-by-step:

- **Chain-of-Thought**: Breaks down complex reasoning into steps
- **Tree-of-Thought**: Explores multiple reasoning paths
- **Self-Consistency**: Generates multiple solutions and selects the most consistent one
- **Reflexion**: Reflects on past performance to improve future results

### Implementation Opportunities

- **Complex Extraction Logic**: Break down complex extraction tasks into steps
- **Multi-Path Extraction**: Try multiple extraction strategies and select the best
- **Self-Correction**: Implement self-correction mechanisms for extraction errors
- **Extraction Planning**: Plan extraction strategies based on document content

## Integration Example: Advanced Document Extraction

Here's an example of how these advanced components could be integrated for document extraction:

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List, Optional

# Define the extraction schema
class MedicalRecord(BaseModel):
    patient_name: str = Field(description="Patient's full name")
    date_of_birth: str = Field(description="Patient's date of birth")
    diagnoses: List[str] = Field(description="List of diagnoses")
    medications: List[str] = Field(description="List of medications")
    visits: List[dict] = Field(description="List of visit records")

# Load and split document
loader = DocumentLoaderFactory.get_loader_for_file("medical_record.pdf")
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

# Create embeddings and vector store
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(chunks, embeddings)
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 5})

# Create LLM with structured output
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4").with_structured_output(MedicalRecord)

# Create extraction chain with ReAct pattern
def extract_with_react(query, docs):
    context = "\n\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in docs])
    
    # Step 1: Reason about the extraction task
    reasoning = llm.invoke(f"Reason about how to extract medical information from this text: {context}")
    
    # Step 2: Act by extracting the information
    extraction_result = llm.invoke(f"Based on this reasoning: {reasoning}\n\nExtract medical information from: {context}")
    
    return extraction_result

# Create the full extraction pipeline
extraction_chain = (
    {"query": RunnablePassthrough(), "docs": retriever}
    | extract_with_react
)

# Run the extraction
result = extraction_chain.invoke("Extract medical information")
print(result)
```
