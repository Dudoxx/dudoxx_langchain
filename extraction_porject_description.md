Automated Large-Text Field Extraction Solution

This solution uses Dudoxx’s OpenAI-compatible LLMs and embedding models to extract structured field values from large texts efficiently. It combines intelligent text chunking, parallel LLM processing, dynamic field-based extraction, temporal normalization, and careful post-processing to ensure accuracy and adaptability across domains.

Chunking Strategy for Large Documents

Intelligent Segmentation: Large input texts are automatically split into self-contained chunks that fit within the 16K token context window of the LLM. Instead of brute-force splitting at a fixed size, the system uses logical boundaries (e.g. section headings, paragraphs, or semantic breaks) to preserve context. This ensures each chunk contains a coherent portion of the text, maximizing relevant content per request ￼. Chunk sizes are chosen to be as large as possible (to include ample context) but below the token limit (with some buffer for prompts and output).

Context Preservation: To avoid cutting off important information at chunk boundaries, the strategy may include slight overlaps or smart boundary detection. For example, if a sentence or field spans two chunks, the overlap ensures the field is fully present in at least one chunk. This minimizes the chance of missing data due to chunking. The goal is to maximize relevant context within each chunk for accuracy, while respecting the model’s context size ￼. Domain-specific cues can guide chunking (e.g. splitting a legal contract by sections, or a medical record by visit), but the approach remains robust even without explicit structure.

Justification: Chunking large documents is essential because LLMs have context limits and degraded accuracy with overly long inputs ￼. By breaking the document into manageable segments, we reduce computational load and allow parallel processing, which improves throughput ￼. Each chunk can be processed independently without overwhelming the model, leading to faster and more accurate results.

Parallel LLM Processing for Speed

Concurrent Requests: The solution leverages up to 20 parallel LLM requests to dramatically speed up processing. Once the document is chunked, each chunk is sent to the LLM simultaneously (up to the concurrency limit) rather than one after the other. This parallelization takes advantage of Dudoxx’s infrastructure to handle multiple LLM calls at once, effectively cutting down overall latency ￼. For example, if 10 chunks are created, the system can dispatch them in parallel (or in batches if more than 20) and aggregate the results as they return.

Throughput Optimization: A parallel dispatcher (or thread pool) handles request distribution to ensure no more than 20 requests run concurrently (preventing overload). As soon as a chunk’s result is ready, it’s passed to the merger while others are still processing, optimizing pipeline efficiency. This design yields near-linear scaling – processing 20 chunks might take roughly the same time as processing one or two, as all are handled in tandem. It greatly improves response time for large texts, making the solution viable in real-time or high-volume settings.

Maintaining Accuracy: Each chunk is processed with the same carefully crafted prompt (including instructions and field list), ensuring consistency across parallel runs. The independence of chunks means the model focuses on a smaller context each time, which can actually improve accuracy compared to one giant context ￼. Additionally, any shared context (like an introduction or repeated info) present in multiple chunks will be reconciled later (see Deduplication & Merging), so parallelization does not cause information loss.

Dynamic Field Extraction per Domain

Field-Driven Prompts: The extraction is guided by a provided field list that can vary by domain or document type. The prompt given to Dudoxx’s LLM for each chunk dynamically includes these target fields, instructing the model to identify and extract the corresponding values from the text. For example, in a medical report the fields might be Patient Name, Date of Birth, Diagnosis, Medications, etc., whereas a legal document might require Case Number, Plaintiff, Defendant, Filing Date, and so on. The LLM is prompted to output the chunk’s information in a structured format (such as JSON) containing only those fields and their values (leaving a field blank or null if not present in that chunk).

Domain Adaptability: Because the field list is easily configurable, the system adapts to different domains without code changes – you simply supply a different set of fields for extraction. The prompt is written in a general way (and possibly includes a few examples) so that the model understands the context of each field. For instance, in a medical context the prompt may hint “Extract the following patient information…”, while in an administrative form it might say “Identify the following details from the document…”. The underlying Dudoxx LLM (being OpenAI-compatible) excels at understanding instructions, enabling a single model to handle varied schemas. This approach ensures we can successfully extract structured data from widely varying document formats by just adjusting prompt content ￼.

Few-Shot and Validation: For tricky domains, the solution can employ few-shot examples in the prompt – e.g. providing a mini example of a text and the expected JSON output – to improve accuracy. However, examples are kept minimal to conserve tokens for actual content. After the LLM produces outputs for each chunk, basic validation checks run (e.g. ensuring required fields are present, data formats look correct). Any obvious errors (like the model misinterpreting a field) can be flagged for later refinement. The design prioritizes capturing all relevant data; any uncertainties can be reviewed in a later validation phase rather than causing omissions.

Temporal Data Handling and Timeline Construction

Date Normalization: Many documents (especially in medical or legal domains) contain multiple dates and time-specific events. The solution standardizes all date/time values extracted, converting them into a consistent format (for example, ISO 8601 YYYY-MM-DD for dates). If the LLM outputs dates in natural language or various formats (e.g. “July 3, 2024” or “03/07/2024”), a post-processing step uses date parsing to unify these formats. This ensures that chronological sorting and comparisons are reliable, as inconsistent date strings are converted to a single standard. Consistent formatting is crucial because downstream systems or JSON consumers expect uniform date representations ￼.

Timeline Assembly: When the content includes a series of events or entries over time, the system organizes them into a chronological timeline. For example, in a medical record with multiple visit notes, or a legal case history with filings and rulings, the extracted events (each with a date) are sorted by date. The output might include a structured array of events, each entry having a standardized date and a description or associated fields, sorted from oldest to newest. By preserving chronological sequence, we maintain the narrative flow of the original document’s timeline.

Context Preservation in Timelines: Each event in the timeline is assembled from possibly multiple fields or sentences (e.g. Date, Event Description, Outcome). The chunk-based extraction will retrieve these pieces; the timeline builder then merges them per date. If an event spans multiple chunks (say the description starts at the end of one chunk and continues in the next), the merging logic combines those parts into one event record before sorting. This ensures events are comprehensive and not split.

Example: Suppose a legal file has entries like “2023-05-10: Complaint filed…”, “2023-06-15: Response submitted…”. The LLM might extract these from different chunks; the temporal handler will standardize the dates to 2023-05-10 and 2023-06-15 (already uniform in this case) and order them correctly in the final timeline array. The same applies for medical notes or any temporal data – the chronology in output mirrors the real-world sequence of events, which is important for analysis.

Deduplication and Merging of Results

Merging Chunks: After all chunks have been processed by the LLM in parallel, the system merges the results into a unified structured output. This involves collating field values from each chunk into a single record for the entire document. If a field was found in multiple chunks, or if overlapping chunks returned the same piece of information, they are combined intelligently. The merging logic looks at context and timestamps to determine if data points refer to the same thing or different ones.

Deduplicating Repeated Data: Redundant data (especially constant fields that appear throughout the document) are deduplicated. For instance, if every page of a contract reiterates the parties’ names or a case number, the extraction from each chunk would yield that info repeatedly. The solution will keep only one unique instance of such fields in the final output. Similarly, if the patient name or ID is present in multiple sections of a medical file, it will appear once in the consolidated results. Deduplication is done by comparing values (and using embeddings for semantic similarity if needed) to ensure that slight variations (e.g. “John A. Doe” vs “John Doe”) are recognized as the same entity. Constant identifiers within the same context are thus merged ￼ ￼.

Context-Based Disambiguation: If the same field can legitimately appear multiple times with different values (for example, Diagnosis might have multiple entries over time, or Address might change in an administrative record), those are not deduplicated but rather treated as distinct records with their own context (or timeline entry). The merging step uses the context or timestamp to distinguish whether repeated field names are duplicates or separate entries. For instance, two different consultation dates with two diagnoses will remain two items in a timeline (because their dates differ), whereas the repeated patient birthdate in every note will be merged into one. In cases of partial data across chunks (like an address split over chunk boundary), the merging logic concatenates or combines the pieces to form the full value.

Integrity Checks: During merging, simple checks can catch inconsistencies. If one chunk extracted a value for a field and another chunk extracted a different value for the same supposed unique field (e.g. two different DOBs), the system can flag this conflict for review rather than choosing arbitrarily. This preserves data integrity for later human validation or refinement, highlighting where the LLM output might need double-checking. However, in most cases, duplicates from overlapping chunks will be identical and are merged silently.

Structured Output Formats

Rich JSON Output: The final consolidated data is output as structured JSON containing all extracted fields and additional metadata. This JSON includes each requested field as keys, with the extracted values (or lists of values, if multiple). It also contains structured sub-sections like a timeline array for temporal events when applicable. The JSON format is machine-friendly and allows easy post-processing or database storage. We include valuable metadata such as: source references (e.g. chunk/page indices where the data was found), standardized timestamps, and possibly confidence scores or flags (e.g. if a value was inferred or had low certainty). This metadata helps with later validation – e.g. a human reviewer could trace a field back to the original text location. The JSON schema is kept consistent, making it easy for downstream systems to parse and utilize the data.

Flat Text for Embeddings: In addition to JSON, the solution produces a flat text file that captures the extracted information in plain language. This is essentially a textual summary or list of the key data, stripped of JSON syntax, making it ideal for feeding into embedding models for vectorization. For example, the flat text might list each field on a new line (or as a sentence):
	•	Name: John Doe
	•	Date of Birth: 1980-05-15
	•	Diagnosis: Diabetes mellitus Type II …

For timeline events, it could list them as dated sentences: 2021-07-10: Patient reported dizziness and was prescribed medication X. Each line is self-contained so that when an embedding model generates vectors, the semantic content of each piece of information is captured. The flat text is organized logically (perhaps grouping static profile fields first, then chronological events) and free of JSON or other markup that could confuse the embedding.

Usage of Embeddings: Once this flat text is generated, Dudoxx’s embedding model can convert it into vector representations. Those vectors can be stored in a vector database or used for similarity search, enabling semantic queries like “find records with diagnosis X” or “find similar case timelines”. The flat text format ensures the embedding model focuses on the meaning of the content, not JSON structure, improving the quality of embeddings. It’s essentially a distilled narrative of the document’s data, perfect for downstream NLP tasks or quick searches.

Example Outputs: If the input was a medical history document, the JSON might look like:

{
  "PatientName": "John Doe",
  "DateOfBirth": "1980-05-15",
  "Conditions": ["Diabetes mellitus Type II"],
  "Medications": ["Metformin", "Lisinopril"],
  "Timeline": [
    {"date": "2021-07-10", "event": "Patient reported dizziness, medication X prescribed."},
    {"date": "2021-08-20", "event": "Follow-up visit, blood sugar levels improved."}
  ],
  "SourcePages": {"PatientName": 1, "DateOfBirth": 1, "Timeline": [2,3]} 
}

And the flat text might be a few lines combining this info in readable form for embedding, without JSON keys. Both outputs give a quick, structured view of the data: JSON for programmatic access and text for vectorization.

Efficiency and Adaptability

This pipeline is optimized for speed and accuracy. By chunking the document, we not only fit the model’s context limit but also improve the model’s focus on relevant context ￼. By running up to 20 chunks in parallel, we achieve high throughput, essential for large documents or batches, without waiting for one long call to finish. Smaller, focused requests tend to be faster and less prone to errors, yielding quick initial responses. At the same time, we maintain data integrity by aggregating and cross-checking all those pieces in the merging stage. The use of standardized formats (JSON, ISO dates, etc.) and inclusion of metadata means the extracted data can be trusted and easily verified ￼.

Crucially, the design is domain-agnostic: whether it’s medical reports, legal contracts, or administrative forms, you can adjust the field list (and slight prompt wording) and the system dynamically adapts to extract the right information. The LLM’s understanding of instructions allows one framework to handle diverse document types ￼. The combination of LLM extraction and embedding-based post-processing (for semantic deduplication or vector output) provides a powerful, flexible solution.

In summary, this fully automated pipeline ensures that even very large texts can be converted into structured data with speed and accuracy. It capitalizes on parallel LLM capabilities, smart chunking within the 16K context window, and rigorous post-processing to deliver both immediate, concise outputs and rich data for further analysis or validation ￼. This way, the system achieves quick responses through distributed small requests, and lays the groundwork for any deeper review or refinement that might follow, without sacrificing the completeness and correctness of the extracted information.
