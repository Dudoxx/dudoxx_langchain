# Automated Large-Text Field Extraction Solution

## Project Overview

The Automated Large-Text Field Extraction Solution is a comprehensive system designed to extract structured information from large text documents. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to process documents in parallel chunks, extract relevant fields, normalize temporal data, merge and deduplicate results, and output structured data in various formats.

This project plan outlines the architecture, components, implementation phases, and deployment strategies for building a robust, scalable, and accurate extraction system.

## Key Features

- **Parallel Processing**: Process large documents by splitting them into chunks and processing them concurrently.
- **Domain-Specific Extraction**: Configure extraction for different domains (medical, legal, financial, etc.).
- **Temporal Normalization**: Standardize dates and times across different formats and build timelines.
- **Result Merging & Deduplication**: Intelligently combine results from multiple chunks and remove duplicates.
- **Flexible Output Formats**: Generate structured outputs in JSON, flat text, and XML formats.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful feedback.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Track system operation with structured, contextual logs.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Deploy as standalone service or distributed system.

## System Architecture

The system is composed of the following core components:

1. **Document Chunker**: Splits large documents into manageable chunks for parallel processing.
2. **Parallel LLM Processor**: Manages concurrent processing of document chunks using LLMs.
3. **Field Extractor**: Extracts structured fields from document chunks using LLMs.
4. **Temporal Normalizer**: Standardizes dates and times and constructs timelines.
5. **Result Merger & Deduplicator**: Combines results from multiple chunks and removes duplicates.
6. **Output Formatter**: Generates structured outputs in various formats.
7. **Extraction Pipeline Controller**: Orchestrates the end-to-end extraction process.
8. **Configuration Service**: Manages system configuration and domain-specific settings.
9. **Logging Service**: Provides structured logging for monitoring and debugging.
10. **Error Handling Service**: Manages exceptions and implements recovery strategies.

## System Flow

The extraction process follows this general flow:

1. **Input**: A document is submitted along with the fields to extract and domain context.
2. **Chunking**: The document is split into manageable chunks with appropriate overlap.
3. **Parallel Processing**: Each chunk is processed concurrently by the LLM.
4. **Field Extraction**: Structured fields are extracted from each chunk.
5. **Temporal Normalization**: Dates and times are standardized across chunks.
6. **Result Merging**: Results from all chunks are combined into a unified output.
7. **Deduplication**: Redundant information is identified and removed.
8. **Output Formatting**: The final results are formatted according to the requested output format.
9. **Response**: The structured extraction results are returned to the client.
