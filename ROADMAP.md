## Prioritization Criteria

When deciding which features to implement next, we will consider the following criteria:

1. **User Impact**: How many users will benefit from the feature?
2. **Technical Feasibility**: How difficult is it to implement the feature?
3. **Strategic Alignment**: How well does the feature align with the project's vision?
4. **Resource Requirements**: What resources are needed to implement the feature?
5. **Maintenance Burden**: How much ongoing maintenance will the feature require?

## Contributing to the Roadmap

This roadmap is a living document and will evolve over time. If you have suggestions for new features or changes to the roadmap, please:

1. Open an issue to discuss the proposed change
2. Reference any relevant use cases or requirements
3. Consider the prioritization criteria when making your case

We welcome community input to help shape the future of the Dudoxx Extraction project!
